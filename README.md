# ConcertWebAppUsingAJAX
Web application to book seats for a concert
1. This is the modified version of previous repo Concert-Web-App(https://github.com/shivKjaju/Concert-Web-App.git). It uses AJAX which adds the asynchronicity factor to the web app which makes things faster.
2. Also this app implemets the most important security features.
      - Sql Injection
      - Cross-Site scripting(XSS)
      - Cross-Site Request Forgery(CSRF)
      - Authentication requirement before password change and SSL implementation for exchanging sensitive data.
      - Cryptographic storage (Encryption of passwords using SHA-256)
